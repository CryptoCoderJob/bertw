# PorscheConnect 

This is an unofficial Porsche Connect API library written in Swift. The primary purpose for this library is to act as a base building block for both mobile, desktop and serverside applications built around the Porsche Connect service.

You will require a My Porsche account to be able to make use of this library.

# CI/CD Status

The library has a comprehensive suite of unit tests that run on GitHub Actions. Currently the test suite is run on a simulated **iPhone 11 Pro** and **iPhone 12 Mini**. Further platforms (Mac, Linux) will be added in the future. 

You can see the current build status of the `main` branch here:
